# About

Rust Detector is a .NET Blazor app that tracks job openings, specifically for the context of the Rust programming language, using Python and SQL Server.

On the last day of every month, the Python-built web scraper scans job openings in a handful of relevant languages to record how many job openings each language has at the end of said month.

The goal of this project is long term. Follow along with Rust's growth and see how the trends in the market change over time, until potentially one day, Rust may even overtake a language like Python and C++.

The data also includes Golang, a general-purpose language developed with the support of Google, with systems programming also in mind.

Note: This sever is currently running on the Azure free tier, and after so many clicks, Azure may disable it for the rest of the month.
